## üìÑ Automated Image-to-PDF Conversion Tool (PowerShell)

**`PS-ImageToPDF`** is a robust, self-contained PowerShell script designed to quickly and reliably combine multiple image files (specifically JPGs) from a directory into a single, cohesive PDF document. It is ideal for digitizing multi-page scans, notes, or documents where maintaining precise numerical order is critical.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Self-Contained Setup:** Automatically checks for and installs the necessary dependency, **ImageMagick**, using the official Windows Package Manager (`winget`). No manual pre-installation steps are needed (administrator rights may be required for the installation).
* **Precise Numeric Sorting:** Files are automatically sorted using **natural numeric order** (e.g., `1.jpg`, `2.jpg`, `10.jpg`) to ensure pages are combined in the correct sequential order.
* **Recursive Processing:** Processes all `.jpg` files found in the current directory and all subdirectories.
* **Clean Output:** Utilizes the powerful `magick` utility for high-quality, reliable PDF generation.
